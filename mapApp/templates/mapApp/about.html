Your knowledge of cycling safety, hazards, and even bike thefts will be analyzed using GIS and statistics to identify hot spots of cycling safety, risk, and crime.  We are constantly updating our maps and technology, so send us feedback.  And stay tuned for updated safety maps generated from YOUR biking experience." %}</p>
