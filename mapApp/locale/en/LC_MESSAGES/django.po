"Personal details such as age and gender are routinely collected in health "
"research including studies examining cycling injuries (e.g., Cripton et al. "
"2015). In addition, details such as rider experience and gender have been "
"shown to be important predictors of cycling safety and risk (Beck et al. "
"2007). The goal of BikeMaps.org is to gather more comprehensive data to "
"better assess cycling safety and risk. Providing personal details will allow "

"\t\t<p>As part of a UVic research project, we are interested in obtaining "
"information regarding your cycling experiences. In particular we would like "
"to know about any incidents that you have had. The data collected is "
"completely anonymous. The survey should take approximately 5 minutes.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>By adding a geographic marker onto this website and answering "
"questions, you are consenting to participate in a study conducted by "
"researchers from the Spatial Pattern Analysis and Research (SPAR) Lab in the "
"Department of Geography at the University of Victoria. All information "
"gathered will be completely anonymous. Volunteers must be 13 years of age or "
"older to participate. Parents or guardians may log the details for "
"participants under the age of 13. Please be advised that once a volunteer "
"participant has submitted their survey, it is impossible to withdraw this "
"data at a later date given that it is fully anonymous. Also, the data may be "
"used in additional future studies. Please be aware that data provided in "
"this study could be linked to data collected in other studies (for e.g., "
"hospital ER intake surveys).</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>The data collected from this research will enable SPAR Lab "
"researchers and graduate students to study the patterns of bike collisions "
"and near misses in various municipalities including the Capital Regional "
"District and Vancouver (BC, Canada). Understanding the geographical patterns "
"to risk for cyclists will enable better decisions to be made regarding "
"future transportation plans for each region.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<p>Funding for this research project has been provided by NSERC Engage "
"and Mitacs grants to Dr. Trisalyn Nelson. Other project partners providing "
"in kind support include: the Captial Regional District (CRD); Pedalheads; "
"KidicalMassyyj; the Canadian Automobile Association; Bunt and Associates; "
